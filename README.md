# ECS 170: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

Welcome to the ECS 170 repository for the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course! This repository contains three significant components: Homework 1 (H1) - "Solve 15 Puzzle using A* Search," Homework 2 (H2) - "Constructing an Image Classifier using a CNN," and the Final Project - "Enhancing Network Anomaly Detection."

## Homework 1: Solve 15 Puzzle using A* Search

The H1 file in this repository represents the first homework assignment, where the task is to solve the classic 15 Puzzle using the A* search algorithm. The assignment likely involves implementing the A* algorithm, creating heuristics, and solving instances of the 15 Puzzle.

## Homework 2: Constructing an Image Classifier using a CNN

This H2 file contains the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras for classifying images in the Fashion MNIST dataset. The goal is to create a robust model capable of distinguishing between different fashion items.

## Final Project: Enhancing Network Anomaly Detection

The Final Project in this repository focuses on enhancing network anomaly detection. This project involves applying various AI techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of network anomaly detection systems.
